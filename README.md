### Simple and customizable feed
 A ready-to-go (and easily changeable) feed of posts from the authenticated user and their friends

### Notifications
Receieve notifications when:

- You're added as a friend
- Someone accepts your friend request
- Someone comments on your post
- Someone replies to a comment thread you are a part of
- Someone adds a reaction to one of your posts

All notifications are currently stored in the database, but can be easily updated to go through other channels such as Slack as well.

### Cloud Upload Support
By default all image uploads are uploaded to a cloud provider of your choice. I recommend Amazon S3 or Backblaze B2. You can of course easily swap this out to host all images locally as well.

## Installation
Coming soon...
